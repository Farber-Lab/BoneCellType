Package: BoneCellType
Version: 0.0.1
Title: Probable cell type identification through bone-associated marker 
    enrichment
Description: The package identifies most probable cell type of single-cell 
    clusters based on enrichment of cluster variable markers within database
    of bone-relevant markers. Two methods are implemented in the package - 
    enrichment based on Fisher's exact test or enrichment based on GSEA 
    analysis. Plotting functions are provided.
